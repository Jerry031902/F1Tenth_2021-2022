In this simple onboarding package, you will make a node that does three things:
*Subscribes to the "/scan" topic
*Figures out the min and max value from the data sent over the topic along with their respective angles
*Publishes to two topics "/min_point" and "max_point" with their respective distance and corresponding angles
