## 10/3 - 10/9: Introduction to ROS - Part 1

We learned the basic concepts of ROS: what it is, how it works, and how we build robots. We covered Nodes, messages, topics, and how they work into the overarching graph of a robotic system.

The slide deck used is located [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-BS7uOYaSVuBZqPPlhUMrAvJ8rqE7bGuX3cjUwzc6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

We then moved to ROS tutorials 1-5. This involved

1. Configuring a ROS environment
2. Creating ROS packages 
3. Building a ROS package
4. Using ROS Nodes
5. Using ROS Topics

Online tutortials can be found [here.](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

The weekly challenge is to push an image of your turtle path to the F1Tenth GitHub.

Post the image to the appropriate folder path i.e. **F1Tenth_2021-2022/media/images/turtle-sim-path**. Make sure to pull the images other have posted before you push yours. 

## 10/10 - 10/16: Introduction to ROS - Part 2

We dove a bit deeper into ROS publishers and subscribers. We looked at some example publishers and subscribers, and examined their code to see exactly how they fit into the overall ROS system. We also experimented with changing data types and contents of messages sent. 

ROS Tutorials used: 

12. Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber 
13. Examining the Publisher and Subscriber

The weekly challenge is similar to last week's - commit & push an image of your modified publisher (talker.py) message to the F1Tenth GitHub, as well as your subscriber (listener.py) outputting the same message.

Post the image to the appropriate folder path i.e. **F1Tenth_2021-2022/media/images/publisher-subscriber-message/**. Make sure to pull the images others have posted before you push yours.
