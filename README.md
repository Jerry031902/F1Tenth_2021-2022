# F1Tenth_2021-2022
Official Repository for Pitt RAS F1Tenth 2021-2022 Team 

To get "up to speed", take a look at our [Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPcZuDyK1n8SSpPkCYEtRkjRHpZaNV0-Qj5Cd3Ra4kE/edit?usp=sharing) Guide

Once you've done that, make sure that you understand the topics covered each week so you can hop on a current project.

## 10/3 - 10/9: Introduction to ROS - Part 1

We learned the basic concepts of ROS: what it is, how it works, and how we build robots. We covered Nodes, messages, topics, and how they work into the overarching graph of a robotic system.

The slide deck used is located [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-BS7uOYaSVuBZqPPlhUMrAvJ8rqE7bGuX3cjUwzc6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

We then moved to ROS tutorials 1-5. This involved

1. Configuring a ROS environment
2. Creating ROS packages 
3. Building a ROS package
4. Using ROS Nodes
5. Using ROS Topics

Online tutortials can be found [here.](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

The weekly challenge is to push an image of your turtle path to the F1Tenth GitHub.

Post the image to the appropriate folder path i.e. **F1Tenth_2021-2022/media/images/turtle-sim-path**. Make sure to pull the images other have posted before you push yours. 

## 10/10 - 10/16: Introduction to ROS - Part 2

We dove a bit deeper into ROS publishers and subscribers. We looked at some example publishers and subscribers, and examined their code to see exactly how they fit into the overall ROS system. We also experimented with changing data types and contents of messages sent. 

ROS Tutorials used: 

12. Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber 
13. Examining the Publisher and Subscriber 

Online tutortials can be found [here.](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

The weekly challenge is similar to last week's - commit & push an image of your modified publisher (talker.py) message to the F1Tenth GitHub, as well as your subscriber (listener.py) outputting the same message.

Post the image to the appropriate folder path i.e. **F1Tenth_2021-2022/media/images/publisher-subscriber-message/**. Make sure to pull the images others have posted before you push yours. 


## 10/24 - 10/30: RGBD Camera 

We finally have our hands on some hardware - the [Intel Realsense d435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/). We split up into 3 groups which will independently attempt to interface the camera with ROS. Ideally, we will be able to use this interface later to do some advanced image processing on the hardware of the car. 

The three groups are shown by members on each card located in the [Trello.](https://trello.com/b/ofsd7s9F/weekly-sprint) If you missed the meeting or don't have a group, feel free to hop on whichever team you'd like. The camera will be located in the RAS room, just down the hall from 1211 BNDM, our usual meeting place. The room is normally locked, but someone should be in there for most of the day. 

If you develop code that you think might be useful in the fututre, either to use or to reference, upload it to the appropriate **RGBD-Camera** directory on the GitHub.
